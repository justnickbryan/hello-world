# hello-world
My first foray into GitHub

## Introduction
I'm a newcomer to programming, data science and open-source, having previously studied and worked in neuroscience and pharma.
I'm taking one small step on my own journey, and a giant leap into the unknown world of GitHub.

Learning Python for data science. I will be uploading personal projects and University assignments to this GitHub.
